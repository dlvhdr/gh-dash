# Issues Section Layout

You can define how a Issues section displays items in its table by setting options for the
available columns. You can define a column's width, whether it grows to fill available space,
and whether the column should be visible at all.

Note that if the length of a column's text exceeds the defined column [`width`], the view
truncates the column's text to two characters shorter than the column's width. For example, if
the width is `6`, `gh-dash` displays as `gh-d`.

Column headings have their color defined by the [`theme.colors.text.primary`] setting.

[`width`]: layout.options.width
[`theme.colors.text.primary`]: theme.colors.text.primary

By default, Issues views display the following columns in the order they're listed:

1. [`updatedAt`] with a width of 7 columns.
1. [`state`] with a width of 3 columns.
1. [`repo`] with a width of 15 columns.
1. [`title`], set to grow to fill available space.
1. [`author`] with a width of 10 columns.
1. [`reviewStatus`] with a width of 3 columns.
1. [`ci`] with a width of 3 columns.
1. [`lines`] with a width of 16 columns.

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
      Even though the `state`, `title`, `comments`, and `reactions` settings
      aren't explicitly defined in your configuration file, they're added to
      the table unless you set their [`hidden`] option to `false`.
