When you use `gh-dash` to display a dashboard for your GitHub work items, you can interact with the
dashboard using key combinations.

This section lists the default keybindings for the dashboard's commands and what they do. Most of
the commands are universal across the dashboard's views. There are also commands that are specific
to the [PRs][01] and [Issues][02] views.

You can also define your own custom keybindings with the `keybindings` setting in your dashboard's
[configuration file][03].
