        The `prSections` setting defines one or more sections to display in the dashboard's PRs
        view as tabs. Each section needs a title, which is displayed as the tab name for the
        section, and a [GitHub search filter]. The dashboard queries GitHub with the search filter
        to populate the list of PRs to display for that section.

        For more information about defining a PR section, see [sref:PR Section Options].

          By default, the PRs view on the dashboard has three sections:

          - The ![styled:`Needs My Review`]() section fetches open PRs where you are a requested
            reviewer.
          - The ![styled:`Involved`]() section fetches open PRs authored by someone else and that
            meet at least one of the following criteria:

            - The PR is assigned to you.
            - The PR's body, a comment on the PR, or one of the PR's commit messages mentions you.
            - You commented on the PR.

      weight: 4
      details: |
        You can use the `repoPaths` setting to map repository names (as keys) to local paths
        (as values). This map coonfigures where to locate repositories when checking out PRs.
        
        The mappings can be exact matches, like the full name or path of a repository, or wildcard
        matches using the `owner` and a partial path.

        An exact match for the full repository name to a full path takes priority over a matching
        wildcard. Wildcard keys must match to a wildcard path.

        The `RepoName` and `RepoPath` keybinding arguments are fully expanded when sent to the
        command.

          title: Matching Repositories
          details: |
            In this example, the first key is defined with a wildcard (`*`) as `dlvhdr/*`, so the
            dashboard will use this entry to resolve the path for any repo in the `dlvhdr`
            namespace, like [`dlvhdr/jb`] or [`dlvhdr/harbor`]. Note that the value for this key
            also uses a wildcard. If the key specifies a wildcard, the value must specify one too.
            
            If a repository in the `dlvhdr` namespace has been cloned into the `~/code/repos`
            folder, the dashboard will be able to checkout PRs for that repository locally.

            If the repository isn't found, the [checkout command] raises an error.

            The second key defines an exact mapping between the `dlvhdr/gh-dash` repository and the
            `~/code/gh-dash` folder. Because this is a non-wildcard mapping, the dashboard will use
            this value to resolve the repository path for `dlvhdr/gh-dash` even though there's also
            an entry for `dlvhdr/*`.
        dlvhdr/*: ~/code/repos/*
        dlvhdr/gh-dash: ~/code/gh-dash

          details: |
            If the key for an `repoPath` entry ends with a wildcard (`*`), its value must also have
            a wildcard. If a key ends with a wildcard but the value doesn't, `gh-dash` won't be
            able to correctly map repositories to folders.

        type: string

            If the key for an `repoPath` entry doesn't have a wildcard (`*`), its value must not
            have a wildcard. If a key ends without a wildcard but the value does, `gh-dash` won't
            be able to correctly map repositories to folders.
