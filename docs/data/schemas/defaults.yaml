    schematize:
      weight: 4
      details: |
        This setting defines how often the dashboard should fetch issues and PRs from GitHub. The
        dashboard fetches work items for every section in the active view when the dashboard loads
        and the first time you switch to the inactive view.

        After the dashboard fetches the work items for the first time, it waits until this setting's
        defined interval elapses before fetching the work items again.

        By default, the dashboard refetches work items every 30 minutes.

        To disable the refetching interval set it to 0.

        You can always use the [refresh current section] or [refresh all sections] command to
        refetch work items in the current view. If you change the search query for a view, the
        dashboard fetches results for the updated query immediately.

        [refresh current section]: /getting-started/keybindings/global/#refresh-current-section
        [refresh all sections]:    /getting-started/keybindings/global/#refresh-all-sections

      details: |
        This setting defines how dates are formatted. The format can be either be "relative" or a 
        [go time format].

        By default, the format is "relative" which fits just inside the default column width of
        updated at in the issues and pull request layouts.

        You may need to adjust the layout column width depending on your format.
