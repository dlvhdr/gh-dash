    Every valid entry for the [sref:`keybindings.prs`] and [sref:`keybindings.issues`] configuration
    options must have a [sref:`key`] and [sref:`command`]. When a user presses the key or key
    combination in the view where those keys are bound, the dashboard shells out and executes the
    command.

    To help you identify your custom commands, an additional [sref:`name`] property can be supplied to describe it in the help menu.
