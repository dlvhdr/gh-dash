title: DASH Integration
---

In order to launch `ENHANCE` from `DASH` [add a custom keybind](../../../configuration/keybindings) to your
`DASH` config:

```yaml
keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: T
      command: gh enhance -R {{.RepoName}} {{.PrNumber}}
```

_Note: You can change the <kbd>T</kbd> keybind to whatever you want, I just remember it
by the `Test` mnemonic._

## Using `tmux`

If you're working with `tmux`, you can also launch it in a new window:

```yaml
keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: T
      command: >-
        tmux new-window '
          gh enhance -R {{.RepoName}} {{.PrNumber}}
        '
```
