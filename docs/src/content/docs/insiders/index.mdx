`DASH Insiders` is a program you can join by sponsoring me on GitHub and gets you early access to
new companion apps and features.

The first app I worked on, [ENHANCE](../enhance), was successfully funded and is now fully open
source.

Currently, there are no benefits other than supporting me in
maintaining my apps and adding new features to them.

In the future I'm intending to create more apps so I can do everything through
the terminal. If you're also passionate about that please do support me and
let's make that a reality!

<form action="#how-do-i-join" class="flex w-full justify-center pt-8">
  <button
    type="submit"
    class="flex items-center gap-2 bg-[var(--sl-color-accent)] px-4 py-2 font-bold text-black"
  >
    Support Me!
    <Icon class="mt-0" name="heart" size="20px" color="var(--color-pink-800)" />
  </button>
</form>

  <p>This is my current sponsorship goal:</p>
  <Sponsorship server:defer />
</div>

## Future Plans

Supporting me will help me make these things a reality:

<div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <FeatureCard
    project="dash"
    feature="Support for More Git Forges"
    description="DASH currently only works against GitHub. This will add support
    for more git forges such as Gitlab, Bitbucket, Codeberg etc."
    future={true}
  />

  <FeatureCard
    project="dash"
    feature="Fully Editable PRs and Issues"
    description="Add support for fully editing a PR / Issue from DASH such as:
    editing the title, description, base branch, deleting a comment etc."
    future={true}
  />

  <FeatureCard
    project="dash"
    feature="Search Autocompletions"
    description="Add autocompletions for the search bar for things like the
    author, owner, repo, commenter, review requested etc."
    future={true}
  />

  <FeatureCard
    project="enhance"
    feature="View Repo-Level Workflow Runs"
    description="The ability to view checks at the repo level - against branches, tags or manually triggered. Currently it's only supported to view checks that are run against a PR."
    future={true}
  />
</div>

### FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What happens if I cancel my sponsorship?</summary>
  If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a
  collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you
  may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like. Just
  remember that [GitHub deletes private
  forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What about sponsorships lower than 5$ a month?</summary>
  Sponsorships lower than $5 a month are also very much appreciated! They won't
  grant you access to Insiders, but they will be counted towards reaching
  sponsorship goals. Every sponsor helps me to implement new features and
  releasing them to the public.
</details>

## How Does this Help Me?

By sponsoring me on one of the eligible tiers you:

1. Get access to my private projects that you can download, use, view the code
   and open issues.
1. Help reach goals towards open sourcing these projects
1. Show support for my other fully open source projects

## Why Sponsorware

I'm a full-stack developer who loves the terminal and I want to invest more time
doing that in a sustainable way.

I have a full time job and this makes it hard to find time for open source.
In order to get some kind of funds to be able to work more on OSS I need an
alternative income. This is an attempt to make it happen.

If you want more details you can [read this](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs) to understand the sponsorware release strategy.

## Terms

- Each app will have a goal towards open sourcing it. Future major releases may
  require additional sponsorship goals.
- Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy.
- If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like. Just remember that [GitHub deletes private forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).
