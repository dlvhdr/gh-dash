### FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What happens if I cancel my sponsorship?</summary>
  If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a
  collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you
  may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like. Just
  remember that [GitHub deletes private
  forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).

<details>
  <summary>What about sponsorships lower than 5$ a month?</summary>
  Sponsorships lower than $5 a month are also very much appreciated! They won't
  grant you access to Insiders, but they will be counted towards reaching
  sponsorship goals. Every sponsor helps me to implement new features and
  releasing them to the public.

## Benefits

By sponsoring me on one of the eligible tiers you:

1. Get access to my private projects that you can download, use, view the code
   and open issues.
1. Help reach goals towards open sourcing these projects
1. Show support for my other fully open source projects

## Why Sponsorware

I'm a full-stack developer who loves the terminal and I want to invest more time
doing that in a sustainable way.

I have a full time job and this makes it hard to find time for open source.
In order to get some kind of funds to be able to work more on OSS I need an
alternative income. This is an attempt to make it happen.

If you want more details you can [read this](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs) to understand the sponsorware release strategy.

## Terms

- Each app will have a goal towards open sourcing it. Future major releases may
  require additional sponsorship goals.
- Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don't make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy.
- If you cancel your subscription, you're automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like. Just remember that [GitHub deletes private forks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).
