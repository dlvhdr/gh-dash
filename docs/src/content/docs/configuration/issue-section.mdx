# Issues Section Options (`issuesSections`)

Defines a section in the dashboard's issues view.

- Every section must define a [`title`] and [`filters`].
- When you define [`limit`] for a section, that value overrides the
  [`defaults.issuesLimit`] setting.
- When you define [`layout`] for a section, that value overrides the
  [`defaults.layout.issue`] setting.

[`title`]: #issues-title-title
[`filters`]: #issues-filters-filters
[`limit`]: #issues-fetch-limit-limit
[`layout`]: #issues-section-layout-layout
[`defaults.issuesLimit`]: /configuration/defaults/#issue-fetch-limit-issueslimit
[`defaults.layout.issue`]: /configuration/defaults/#layout-options-layout

## Issues Title (`title`)

This setting defines the section's name. The dashboard displays this value in the tabs for
the issues view.

## Issues Filters (`filters`)

This setting defines the [GitHub search filters][01] for the Issues in the section's table.

Don't specify `is:issue` for this setting. The dashboard always adds that filter for Issues
sections.

You can define any combination of search filters. To make it easier to read and maintain
your filters, we recommend using the `>-` syntax after the `filter` key and writing one
filter per line.

For example:

```yaml
- # Involved
  filter: >-
    is:open
    involves:@me
    -author:@me
    updated>={{ nowModify "-2w" }}
```

For more information about writing filters for searching GitHub, see [Searching].

[Searching]: /configuration/searching

## Issues Section Layout (`layout`)

You can define how a Issues section displays items in its table by setting options for the
available columns. You can define a column's width, whether it grows to fill available space,
and whether the column should be visible at all.

Note that if the length of a column's text exceeds the defined column [`width`], the view
truncates the column's text to two characters shorter than the column's width. For example, if
the width is `6`, `gh-dash` displays as `gh-d`.

Column headings have their color defined by the [`theme.colors.text.issueimary`] setting.

[`width`]: /configuration/layout/options#layout-options-width
[`theme.colors.text.issueimary`]: /configuration/theme

## Issues Fetch Limit (`limit`)

| Type    | Minimum | Default |
| :------ | :-----: | :-----: |
| Integer |    1    |   20    |

This setting defines how many Issues the dashboard should fetch for the section when:

- The dashboard first loads.
- The [fetch interval] elapses.
- You navigate to the next issue in a table without another fetched issue to display.
- You use the [refresh current section] or [refresh all sections] commands.

This setting overrides the [`defaults.issuesLimit`] setting.

[fetch interval]: /configuration/defaults/#refetch-interval-in-minutes-refetchintervalminutes
[refresh current section]: /getting-started/keybindings/global/#r---refresh-current-section
[refresh all sections]: /getting-started/keybindings/global/#r---refresh-all-sections
[`defaults.issuesLimit`]: /configuration/defaults/#issue-fetch-limit
