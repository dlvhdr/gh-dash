# Issues Section Options (`issuesSections`)

Defines a section in the dashboard's issues view.

- Every section must define a [`title`] and [`filters`].
- When you define [`limit`] for a section, that value overrides the
  [`defaults.issuesLimit`] setting.
- When you define [`layout`] for a section, that value overrides the
  [`defaults.layout.issue`] setting.

[`title`]: #issues-title-title
[`filters`]: #issues-filters-filters
[`limit`]: #issues-fetch-limit-limit
[`layout`]: #issues-section-layout-layout
[`defaults.issuesLimit`]: /configuration/defaults/#issue-fetch-limit-issueslimit
[`defaults.layout.issue`]: /configuration/defaults/#layout-options-layout

## Issues Title (`title`)

This setting defines the section's name. The dashboard displays this value in the tabs for
the issues view.

## Issues Filters (`filters`)

This setting defines the [GitHub search filters][01] for the Issues in the section's table.

Don't specify `is:issue` for this setting. The dashboard always adds that filter for Issues
sections. 

Note issues from archived repositories are excluded by default with `archived:false`.

You can define any combination of search filters. To make it easier to read and maintain
your filters, we recommend using the `>-` syntax after the `filter` key and writing one
filter per line.

For example:

```yaml
- # Involved
  filter: >-
    is:open
    involves:@me
    -author:@me
    updated>={{ nowModify "-2w" }}
```

For more information about writing filters for searching GitHub, see [Searching].

## Issues Section Layout (`layout`)

You can define how a Issues section displays items in its table by setting options for the
available columns. You can define a column's width, whether it grows to fill available space,
and whether the column should be visible at all.

Note that if the length of a column's text exceeds the defined column [`width`], the view
truncates the column's text to two characters shorter than the column's width. For example, if
the width is `6`, `gh-dash` displays as `gh-d`.

Column headings have their color defined by the [`theme.colors.text.issueimary`] setting.

[`width`]: /configuration/layout/options#layout-options-width
[`theme.colors.text.issueimary`]: /configuration/theme

## Issues Fetch Limit (`limit`)

| Type    | Minimum | Default |
| :------ | :-----: | :-----: |
| Integer |    1    |   20    |

This setting defines how many Issues the dashboard should fetch for the section when:

- The dashboard first loads.
- The [fetch interval] elapses.
- You navigate to the next issue in a table without another fetched issue to display.
- You use the [refresh current section] or [refresh all sections] commands.

This setting overrides the [`defaults.issuesLimit`] setting.
