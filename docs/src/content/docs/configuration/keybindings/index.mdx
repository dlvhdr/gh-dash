title: Custom Keybindings
---

`dash` allows you to override existing keybindings as well as add custom ones.

Every valid entry for the configuration options must have a `key` and `command`.
When a user presses the key or key combination the dashboard shells out and executes the command.

To help you identify your custom commands, an additional `name` property can be supplied to describe it in the help menu.

There are 3 types of keybindings: `universal`, `prs` and `issues`.

## Universal Keybindings

Define keybindings that will work in any view.

For example:

```yaml
keybindings:
  universal:
    - key: g
      name: lazygit
      command: >
        cd {{.RepoPath}} && lazygit
    - key: s
      builtin: search
```

### Built-in Commands

The following built-in universal commands can be overridden with custom keybinds:

| Command         | Description                                     |

## Notification Keybindings

Define any number of keybindings for the notifications view or override existing ones.

For example:

```yaml
keybindings:
  notifications:
    - key: d
      builtin: markAsDone
    - key: D
      builtin: markAllAsDone
```

### Available Command Arguments

The command template receives different fields depending on whether the sidebar has been opened:

| State            | PR template fields                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sidebar not open | `RepoName`, `PrNumber`, `RepoPath`       |
| Sidebar open     | + `HeadRefName`, `BaseRefName`, `Author` |

| State            | Issue template fields                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Sidebar not open | `RepoName`, `IssueNumber`, `RepoPath` |
| Sidebar open     | + `Author`                            |

If a template references a sidebar-only field (e.g., `{{.HeadRefName}}`) before the sidebar is opened, the template engine’s `missingkey=error` option produces an error message. This is intentional — users should open the notification first to populate the full data.

### Built-in Commands

The following built-in notifications commands can be overridden with custom keybinds:

| Command          | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`           | view notification (fetches content, marks as read) |
| `markAsDone`     | mark as done (removes from inbox)                  |
| `markAllAsDone`  | mark all as done                                   |
| `markAsRead`     | mark as read                                       |
| `markAllAsRead`  | mark all as read                                   |
| `unsubscribe`    | unsubscribe from thread                            |
| `toggleBookmark` | toggle bookmark                                    |

See [notification keys](../../getting-started/keybindings/selected-notification/) for more details.
