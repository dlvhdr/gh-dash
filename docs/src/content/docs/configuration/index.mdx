`dash` has extensive configuration options.

- The config is usually created under `$HOME/.config/gh-dash/config.yml`, but this
  changes between operating systems and `dash` has many ways to override that.
- `dash` will also look for a `.gh-dash.yml` file if in a git repository to allow
  for project specific configuration.
- Use the [`--config`][01] flag or `$GH_DASH_CONFIG` to specify an alternate configuration.

<details>
  <summary>How does `dash` determine which configuration file to use?</summary>
  Using the following logic:
1. If `$GH_DASH_CONFIG` is a non-empty string, `dash` will use this file for
   its configuration.
2. If `$GH_DASH_CONFIG` isn't set and you're in a git repository, it will look for `.gh-dash.yml` or `.gh-dash.yaml`
   in the repository root.
3. If neither of the above applies, then:
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is a non-empty string, the default path is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh-dash/config.yml`.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isn't set, then:
    - On Linux and macOS systems, the default path is `$HOME/.config/gh-dash/config.yml`.
    - On Windows systems, the default path is `%USERPROFILE%\.config\gh-dash\config.yml`.
