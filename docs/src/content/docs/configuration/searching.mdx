  How to search and filter issues and prs

# Searching

Searching for prs and issues is done by defining sections and their filters.
Search filters are defined using [GitHub search filters][01].

For example, this section, shows open PRs authored by anyone but me, which were updated in the last 2 weeks.

```yaml
prsSections:
  - title: Review
    filter: >-
      is:open
      -author:@me
      updated>={{ nowModify "-2w" }}
```

Note: don't specify `is:pr` for this setting. The dashboard always adds that filter for PR
sections. Results from archived repositories are excluded by default with `archived:false`.

You can define any combination of search filters. To make it easier to read and maintain
your filters, we recommend using the `>-` syntax after the `filter` key and writing one
filter per line.

For more information about writing filters for searching GitHub, see [Searching issues and pull requests][02].

## Search Templates

In addition to GitHub's filters, gh-dash adds templating functions.

### `nowModify`

The `nowModify` function helps you calculate relative dates in the ISO-8601 format (which is what GitHub expects).

Given the date today is 2025-02-02, a search filter of `updated>={{ nowModify "-1mo" }}` will output `updated>=2025-01-02`.

A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `1w`, `-8h` or `1mo2w`.

The available units are:

- [Go's builtin durations](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) - `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`
- Additionally:
  - `d`/`D` for days
  - `w`/`W` for weeks
  - `M`/`mo` for months
  - `y`/`Y` for years

## Smart Filtering

By default, if the directory you launch `dash` from is a clone of a remote GitHub repo (or if you
have the `GH_REPO` environment variable set to a particular remote), then for any of your PR
sections and issue sections with `filters` values in your [configuration](/configuration) that don’t
have an explicit `repo:` field, `dash` adds a `repo:<RepoName>` field to the search-bar value for
them (where _`<RepoName>`_ is the name of the remote repo).

That is, `dash` further filters those sections down to only the PRs/issues for the GitHub
repo name specified in your `GH_REPO` environment variable — or else the repo name of the remote
tracked by the clone directory from which `dash` launched.

For that, `dash` first checks and uses the repo name in the `GH_REPO` environment variable (if
you have that set). If `dash` doesn’t find that, then it next checks for the value of the remote
repo name tracked by the clone directory from which you launched `dash` — by looking through all
GitHub remotes configured for that clone in the following order:

1. `upstream`
2. `github`
3. `origin`

…and, otherwise, if `dash` finds no remotes with any of those names, then it uses the repo name
for the first remote in the output that `git remote` shows.

To disable Smart Filtering at launch, set `smartFilteringAtLaunch` to `false` in your [configuration](/configuration).

```yaml
smartFilteringAtLaunch: false
```

To toggle Smart Filtering on or off for the current section you’re currently viewing, either use the
`t` key — or else use whatever custom keybinding you have set for the `togglesearch` builtin in the
`keybindings` section of your [configuration](/configuration).

You can also manually edit the search bar (press `/`) to remove or replace the `repo:` filter, then
press Enter. The Smart Filtering state automatically syncs to match your edit — so if you remove the
`repo:` filter from the search bar, Smart Filtering turns off for that section, and vice versa.
