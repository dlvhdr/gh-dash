title: Schema
---

The `dash` configuration schema is published here:

[`https://gh-dash.dev/schema.json`][02]

## Using the Schema in Neovim

1. Install the [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) LSP
2. Follow the guide in [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md#yamlls) to set it up
3. Add the following line to the top of your configuration file:

   ```
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://gh-dash.dev/schema.json
   ```

With the directive comment at the top of your configuration or the VS Code settings file, you can
then open your configurations and edit them with support for validation. When you hover on an
option in your configuration file, you'll get a brief synopsis of the option and a link to its
documentation on this site.

## Using the Schema in VS Code

You can get edit-time feedback, validation, and IntelliSense for your configurations in VS Code by
following these steps:

1. Install [Red Hat's YAML extension for VS Code][03].
1. Open your `dash` configuration file.
1. Add the following line to the top of your configuration file:

   ```
   # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://gh-dash.dev/schema.json
   ```

1. Instead of adding a comment to your configuration file, you could create the
   `.vscode/settings.json` file in your `dash` configuration folder and add this setting:

   ```json
   {
     "yaml.schemas": {
       "https://gh-dash.dev/schema.json": "*.yml"
     }
   }
   ```
