title: Repo Paths
---

You can use the `repoPaths` setting to map repository names (as keys) to local paths
(as values). This map configures where to locate repositories when checking out PRs.

The mappings can be exact matches, like the full name or path of a repository, or wildcard
matches using the `owner` and a partial path.

An exact match for the full repository name to a full path takes priority over a matching
wildcard. Wildcard keys must match to a wildcard path.

The `RepoName` and `RepoPath` keybinding arguments are fully expanded when sent to the
command.

## Examples

### Matching Repositories

```yaml
repoPaths:
  dlvhdr/*: ~/code/repos/*
  dlvhdr/gh-dash: ~/code/gh-dash
```

In this example, the first key is defined with a wildcard (`*`) as `dlvhdr/*`, so the
dashboard will use this entry to resolve the path for any repo in the `dlvhdr`
namespace, like `dlvhdr/jb` or `dlvhdr/harbor`. Note that the value for this key
also uses a wildcard. If the key specifies a wildcard, the value must specify one too.

If a repository in the `dlvhdr` namespace has been cloned into the `~/code/repos`
folder, the dashboard will be able to checkout PRs for that repository locally.

If the repository isn't found, the checkout command raises an error.

The second key defines an exact mapping between the `dlvhdr/gh-dash` repository and the
`~/code/gh-dash` folder. Because this is a non-wildcard mapping, the dashboard will use
this value to resolve the repository path for `dlvhdr/gh-dash` even though there's also
an entry for `dlvhdr/*`.

## Pattern Properties

### With a Wildcard

If the key for an `repoPath` entry ends with a wildcard (`*`), its value must also have
a wildcard. If a key ends with a wildcard but the value doesn't, `gh-dash` won't be
able to correctly map repositories to folders.

### Without a Wildcard

If the key for an `repoPath` entry doesn't have a wildcard (`*`), its value must not
have a wildcard. If a key ends without a wildcard but the value does, `gh-dash` won't
be able to correctly map repositories to folders.
