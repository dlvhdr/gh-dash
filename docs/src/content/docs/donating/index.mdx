title: Donating ❤️

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import Sponsorship from "../../../components/Sponsorship.astro";

Donations are the primary way to support me in maintaining these projects.
If you enjoy my work and want to help, consider supporting me with a donation!

I'm also trying out a Sponsorware model where you can support me by joining the <a href="../insiders">Insiders</a> program to get early access features and apps.

## Goal

<div class="m-auto mt-12 flex flex-col gap-2 text-center md:w-full lg:w-1/2">
  <p>This is my current sponsorship goal</p>
  <Sponsorship server:defer />
</div>

Reaching this goal would help me spend more time on my projects and hopefully 🤞🏽
become a full time OSS maintainer one day.

_This is my dream_, to build projects sponsored by individuals with the sole focus on its users - no investors, no line go
up.

## How to Donate?

To become a sponsor go to:

  width="100%"

></iframe>

Thank you very much! ❤️
