Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating
a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Install Required Tooling

Our project uses [Devbox](https://github.com/jetpack-io/devbox) to manage its development environment.

Using Devbox will get your dev environment up and running easily and make sure we're all using the same tools with the same versions.

- Clone this repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dlvhdr/gh-dash.git && cd gh-dash
```

- Install `devbox`

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.jetpack.io/devbox | bash
```

- Start the `devbox` shell and run the setup (will take a while on first time)

```sh
devbox shell
```

_This will create a shell where all required tools are installed._

### Automatic `devbox shell` (Optional)

Set up [`direnv`](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/ide_configuration/direnv/) so `devbox shell` runs automatically

- Install with your package manager e.g. `brew install direnv`
- Add the following line at the end of the `~/.bashrc` file: `eval "$(direnv hook bash)"`
  - See [direnv's installation instructions](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) for other shells.
- Enable `direnv` by running `direnv allow`

If using VSCode, Install the extension:

- Follow [this guide](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/ide_configuration/vscode/) to set up VSCode to automatically run `devbox shell`.

### Troubleshooting

- delete the `.devbox` dir at the project's root

## Getting Started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, familiar yourself with:

- [Bubbletea][01] - the TUI framework we're using
- [The Elm architecture][02]
- [charmbracelet/glow][03] - for parsing and presenting markdown

### Code structure

- `ui/` - this is the code that's responsible on rendering the different parts of the TUI
- `data/` - the code that fetches data from GitHub's GraphQL API
- `config/` - code to parse the user's `config.yml` file
- `utils/` - various utilities

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, first search if an issue already exists.

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form][04].

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues][05] to find one that interests you.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers
  understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue][06] if you are solving one.

### Debugging

- Pass the debug flag: `go run gh-dash.go --debug`
- Write to the log using Go's builtin `log` package
- View the log by running `tail -f debug.log`

```go
import "github.com/charmbracelet/log"

// more code...

log.Debug("Some message", "someVariable", someVariable)
```
