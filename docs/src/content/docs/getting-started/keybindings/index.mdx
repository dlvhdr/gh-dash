When you use `dash` to display a dashboard for your GitHub work items, you can interact with the
dashboard using key combinations.

This section lists the default keybindings for the dashboard's commands and what they do. Most of
the commands are universal across the dashboard's views. There are also commands that are specific
to the [PRs][01] and [Issues][02] views.

You can also define your own custom keybindings with the `keybindings` setting in your dashboard's
[configuration file][03].

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Global"
    href="./global"
    description="Lists the default keybindings for controlling the dashboard globally."
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Selected Item"
    href="./selected-item"
    description="Lists the default keybindings for interacting with active items in the dashboard in any view."
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Selected PR"
    href="./selected-pr"
    description="Lists the default keybindings for interacting with an actively selected item in the PRs view for the dashboard."
