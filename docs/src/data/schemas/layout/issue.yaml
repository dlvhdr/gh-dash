title: Issue Section Layout
description: Defines the columns an issue section displays in its table.
schematize:
  details: |
    You can define how an issue section displays items in its table by setting options for the
    available columns. You can define a column's width, whether it grows to fill available space,
    and whether the column should be visible at all.

    Note that if the length of a column's text exceeds the defined column [sref:`width`], the view
    truncates the column's text to two characters shorter than the column's width. For example, if
    the width is `6`, `gh-dash` displays as ![styled:`gh-d`]().

    Column headings have their color defined by the [sref:`theme.colors.text.primary`] setting.

    [sref:`width`]:                     layout.options.width
    [sref:`theme.colors.text.primary`]: theme.colors.text.primary
  format: yaml

      By default, issue views display the following columns in the order they're listed:

      1. [sref:`updatedAt`] with a width of 7 columns.
      1. [sref:`state`] with a width of 3 columns.
      1. [sref:`repo`] with a width of 15 columns.
      1. [sref:`title`], set to grow to fill available space.
      1. [sref:`creator`] with a width of 10 columns.
      1. [sref:`comments`] with a width of 3 columns.
      1. [sref:`reactions`] with a width of 3 columns.

      the table unless you set their [sref:`hidden`] option to `false`.
