## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring

A section is defined by a:

- title - shown in the TUI
- filters - how the repo's PRs should be filtered - these are plain [GitHub filters](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)

All configuration is provided within a `config.yml` file under the extension's directory (either a `.gh-dash.yml` file if inside a repo, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh-dash` or `~/.config/gh-dash/` or your OS config dir) or `$GH_DASH_CONFIG`.

An example `config.yml` file contains:

```yml
prSections:
  - title: My Pull Requests
    filters: is:open author:@me
    layout:
      author:
        hidden: true
        # width: <number of columns>
        # grow: <bool> this will make the column grow in size
  - title: Needs My Review
    filters: is:open review-requested:@me
  - title: Subscribed
    filters: is:open -author:@me repo:cli/cli repo:dlvhdr/gh-dash
    limit: 50 # optional limit of rows fetched for this section
issuesSections:
  - title: Created
    filters: is:open author:@me
  - title: Assigned
    filters: is:open assignee:@me
  - title: Subscribed
    filters: is:open -author:@me repo:microsoft/vscode repo:dlvhdr/gh-dash
defaults:
  layout:
    prs:
      repo:
        grow: true,
        width: 10
        hidden: false
    # issues: same structure as prs
  prsLimit: 20 # global limit
  issuesLimit: 20 # global limit
  preview:
    open: true # whether to have the preview pane open by default
    width: 60 # width in columns
  refetchIntervalMinutes: 30 # will re-fetch all sections every 30 minutes
repoPaths: # configure where to locate repos when checking out PRs
  :owner/:repo: ~/src/github.com/:owner/:repo # template if you always clone GitHub repos in a consistent location
  dlvhdr/*: ~/code/repos/dlvhdr/* # will match dlvhdr/repo-name to ~/code/repos/dlvhdr/repo-name
  dlvhdr/gh-dash: ~/code/gh-dash # will not match wildcard and map to specified path
keybindings: # optional, define custom keybindings - see more info below
theme: # optional, see more info below
pager:
  diff: less # or delta for example
confirmQuit: false # show prompt on quit or not
```

### üóÉ Running with a different config file

You can run `gh dash --config <path-to-file>` to run `gh-dash` against another config file.

This lets you easily define multiple dashboards with different sections.<br>
It can be useful if you want to have a üß≥ work and üë©‚Äçüíª personal dashboards, or if you want to view multiple dashboards at the same time.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

You can:

1. Override the builtin commands keybindings
2. Define your own custom keybindings to run bash commands using [Go Templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).

#### Overriding builtin commands keybindings

To override the "checkout" keybinding you can include this in your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: O
      builtin: checkout
```

The list of available builtin commands are:

1. `universal`: up, down, firstLine, lastLine, togglePreview, openGithub, refresh, refreshAll, pageDown, pageUp, nextSection, prevSection, search, copyurl, copyNumber, help, quit
2. `prs`: approve, assign, unassign, comment, diff, checkout, close, ready, reopen, merge, update, watchChecks, viewIssues
3. `Issues`: assign, unassign, comment, close, reopen, viewPrs

To unbind the "esc" keybinding you can include this in your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: esc
      builtin:
```

#### Defining custom keybindings

This is available for both PRs and Issues.
For PRs, the available arguments are:

| Argument      | Description                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RepoName`    | The full name of the repo (e.g. `dlvhdr/gh-dash`)                               |
| `RepoPath`    | The path to the Repo, using the `config.yml` `repoPaths` key to get the mapping |
| `PrNumber`    | The PR number                                                                   |
| `HeadRefName` | The PR's remote branch name                                                     |
| `BaseRefName` | The PR's base branch name                                                       |

For Issues, the available arguments are:

| Argument      | Description                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RepoName`    | The full name of the repo (e.g. `dlvhdr/gh-dash`)                               |
| `RepoPath`    | The path to the Repo, using the `config.yml` `repoPaths` key to get the mapping |
| `IssueNumber` | The Issue number                                                                |

**Examples**

1. To review a PR with either Neovim or VSCode include the following in your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
repoPaths:
  dlvhdr/gh-dash: ~/code/gh-dash

keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: c
      command: >
        tmux new-window -c {{.RepoPath}} '
          gh pr checkout {{.PrNumber}} &&
          nvim -c ":DiffviewOpen master...{{.HeadRefName}}"
        '
    - key: v
      command: >
        cd {{.RepoPath}} &&
        code . &&
        gh pr checkout {{.PrNumber}}
```

2. To pin an issue include the following in your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
keybindings:
  issues:
    - key: P
      command: gh issue pin {{.IssueNumber}} --repo {{.RepoName}}
```

### üö• Repo Path Matching

Repo name to path mappings can be exact match (full name, full path) or wildcard matched using the `owner` and partial path.

An exact match for the full repo name to a full path takes priority over a matching wildcard, and wildcard matches must match to a wildcard path.

An `:owner/:repo` template can be specified as a generic fallback.

```yaml
repoPaths:
  :owner/:repo: ~/src/github.com/:owner/:repo # template if you always clone GitHub repos in a consistent location
  dlvhdr/*: ~/code/repos/dlvhdr/* # will match dlvhdr/repo-name to ~/code/repos/dlvhdr/repo-name
  dlvhdr/gh-dash: ~/code/gh-dash # will not match wildcard and map to specified path
```

The `RepoName` and `RepoPath` keybinding arguments are fully expanded when sent to the command.

### üíÖ Custom Themes

To override the default set of terminal colors and instead create your own color scheme, you can define one in your `config.yml` file.
If you choose to go this route, you need to specify _all_ of the following keys as colors in hex format (`#RRGGBB`), otherwise validation will fail.

```yaml
theme:
  ui:
    sectionsShowCount: true
    table:
      showSeparator: true
  colors:
    text:
      primary: "#E2E1ED"
      secondary: "#666CA6"
      inverted: "#242347"
      faint: "#3E4057"
      warning: "#F23D5C"
      success: "#3DF294"
      error: "#D20F39"
    background:
      selected: "#39386B"
    border:
      primary: "#383B5B"
      secondary: "#39386B"
      faint: "#2B2B40"
```

### ü™ü Layout

You can customize each section's layout as well as the global layout.

For example, to hide the `author` column for **all** PR sections, include the following in your `config.yml`.

```
defaults:
  layout:
    prs:
      author:
        hidden: true
```

- For `prs` the column names are: `updatedAt, repo, author, title, reviewStatus, state, ci, lines, assignees, base`.
- For `issues` the column names are: `updatedAt, state, repo, title, creator, assignees, comments, reactions`.
- The available properties to control are: `grow` (false, true), `width` (number of cells), and `hidden` (false, true).
